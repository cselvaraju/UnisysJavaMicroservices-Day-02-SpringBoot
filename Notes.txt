During Autowiring, if there are multiple beans that are matching
then the order of bean resolution for dependency injection is 
1. byType
2. byName

If @Autowired annotation is on the class field (data member / property)
	then Setter Injection is used. (So a default constructor must be available
	in the class).
	
If @Autowired annotation is on a setter method then setter injection will be carried out.

If @Autowired annotation is added to a constructor then
	Constructor Injection will be carried out.
	
	
JSR 250 Annotations
@PostConstruct
	Run code after the bean dependencies have been injected
	
@PreDestroy
	Run code before the bean is destroyed (used for any last-minute cleanup)
	
@Resource
	Combination of @Autowired and @Qualifier annotations
